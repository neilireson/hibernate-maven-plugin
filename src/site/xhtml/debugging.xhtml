  <p>
  If you are new to <code>hibernate-maven-plugin</code>, in many cases, the
  <a href="./configuration.html#precedence">Configuration-Method-Precedence</a>
  may be the source of configuration errors.
  To solve this problem, you should run maven with the debugging output
  enabled.
  For example, by executing:
  </p>
  <pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-html">
mvn -X compile hibernate:create</pre>
  <p>
  (The <code>compile</code> might be necessary, because <code>hibernate-maven-plugin</code>
  has to scan the compiled classes for annotations!)
  </p>
  <p>
  Unlike the majority of the maven-plugins, <code>hibernate-maven-plugin</code> was
  designed to give a good many hints, when debugging is enabled.
  Because, if you do not know, what went wrong, you can't fix it!
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>But be warned:</strong> <code>hibernate-maven-plugin</code> tends to be very chatty ;)
